# pythonguessinggame
This is a simple python guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 0 and 10

The main purpose of this program was to test my knowledge of file reading and writing, and therefore it has very limited checks surrounding the "authenticity" of the values entered. Expect errors if non-integers are entered
